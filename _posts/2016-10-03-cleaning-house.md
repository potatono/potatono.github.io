In 2017 I will return to Black Rock City for my sixth Burning Man.  I'm trying to keep my commitments
and project load minimal so I don't overload myself like I did in 2012.  Two projects so far: 
[DuoSkin](http://duoskin.media.mit.edu) is a method for making electronic temporary tattoos and 
learning to juggle clubs, possibly torches.  Before I can dig into those I need to get 
[Mushroom Cabal](/projects/mushroom-cabal/) and [Linkfilter](/projects/linkfilter) into a steady
state.

Mushroom Cabal isn't really functional at all right now.  It needs a couple solid weeks of work.
I need to add authentication, media playback, and warping.  Honestly it might need to get mothballed
for lack of interest.

Linkfilter needs at least the integrated post view and an open registration model.  Ideally I'd like
to rework its economy, but that might be too much to take on.
