## Undocumented

### Door Bot

A crappy robot that I used at NYC Resistor to lower a key on a string to locked out visitors.  "I don't like it" says one reviewer.

### Temple of the Unticketed

[Max Henstell](http://www.kapamaki.net/) and I applied for a Burning Man Arts grant for this project in 2015.  It was way over ambitious and I'm very glad they
did not award us that grant.  [GitHub](http://nycresistor.github.com/TotU/)

### Megamario

I modified a python implementation of [Mario Level 1](https://github.com/justinmeister/Mario-Level-1) to work with [Trammell Hudsons]() [Megascroller](https://trmm.net/Megascroller) LED display.  In the modified version the players have to dash around the display to keep up with Mario.  [Github](https://github.com/nycresistor/Mario-Level-1)

A simple web based game that uses the accelerometer data to simluate throwing your phone across the room.  [GitHub](https://github.com/potatono/virtual-iphone-toss)
