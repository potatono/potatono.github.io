An experimental social interaction envrionment.  The goal is to create a game-like space where particiapants
feel comfortable sharing and interacting with each other.

Very much still a work in progress.  The project page has a [live demo](https://potatono.github.io/mushroom-cabal-game/).

## [Linkfilter](/projects/linkfilter/)

A community weblog I co-founded in 2000 that uses gamification elements to drive interaction and prevent spam.

It was shutdown in 2009, and then revived in 2015.  It's up at [linkfilter.net](http://linkfilter.net/), but currently registration is still closed.
